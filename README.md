Hello!
Here's a git automation tool created with python[bat and bash version would be pushed soon]

Use:
There are three files in this repo that you can add to your project. Remember to add them to your .gitignore file to avoid pushing it to your repos.

Pusher.py:
pusher.py has three commands that executes when ran;
git add .
git commit
git push
This is to push changes to your repo. Feel free to edit to suit your commands

Existing_repo.py:
To push an existing local repo to your github repo use this.

Repo_creation.py
Quite self-explanatory,
This file is to create a local repo on your device and push it to your github repo

All you need to do is run; python 'filename.py'
And fill in the neccessary params
